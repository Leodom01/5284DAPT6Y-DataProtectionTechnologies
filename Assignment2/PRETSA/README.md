# PRETSA (Standard-Version/Conference Paper)
PRETSA (PREfix-Tree based event log SAnitisation for t-closeness) is an algorithm to generate privatizied event logs that comply with k-anonymity and t-closeness. These event logs can be used for process discovery a subfield of Process Mining. We provide an implementation of PRETSA in Python 3. Our code is available under the MIT license.

## Requirements
To run our algorithm you need the following Python packages:
- Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/index.html)
- SciPy (https://www.scipy.org)
- NumPy (http://www.numpy.org)
- AnyNode (https://anytree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

We did run our algorithm only with Python 3, so we can not guarantee that it works with Python 2.

## How to run PRETSA

The algorithm PRETSA itself is implemented in the file *pretsa.py*. To run the algorithm you first have to initiate the *Pretsa* class and hand over an event log represented as a pandas dataframe:
```
eventLog = pd.read_csv(filePath, delimiter=";")
pretsa = Pretsa(eventLog)
```
As a next step you run the PRETSA algorithm with your choosen k-anonymity(an integer) and t-closesness(a float) parameter. The algorithm then returns the cases that have been modified:
```
cutOutCases = pretsa.runPretsa(k,t)
```
Note that the privacy constraint k-anonymity gets stronger with a higher value, while t-closeness can have values between 1.0 and 0.0 with the lowest value giving the strongest privacy guarantee.

Finally we can return our privatizied event log as a pandas dataframe:
```
privateEventLog = pretsa.getPrivatisedEventLog()
```

Please consider that your original event log must contain at least the following attributes(column names), so that PRETSA can process it:
- Case Id
- Activity
- Duration

If you want to use different attribute column names you can change the following variables in *pretsa.py*:
- caseIDColName
- activityColName
- annotationColName

## How to repeat our experiments

We will describe in this section how we conducted our experiments for our ICPM 2019 submission:

First we generated the duration annotation with the following script:
```
python add_annotation_duration.py <fileName> <dataset>
```

Next by running the script *runPretsa.py* we generated the event log's generated by PRETSA with choosen parameters for *k* and *t*:
```
python runPretsa.py <fileName> <k> <t>
```
To generate privatizied event logs with our baseline approach we run the script *generate_baseline_log.py*:
```
python generate_baseline_log.py <fileName> <k> <t>
```

To compare the fitness and precision of the event logs we used ProM. The calculate the statistcs of event logs( e.g. number of variants in the log) we run the script *calculateDatasetStatistics.py*. Alternatively we can run the script *calculateBaselineStatistics.py* and *calculatePRETSAEventLogStatistics.py* to save the number of variants in the PRETSA/baseline event logs into a csv-file:
```
python calculateDatasetStatustics.py <fileName>
python calculatBaselineEventLogStatistics.py <dictName>
python calculatePRETSAEventLogStatistics.py <dictName>
```

To calculate the annotation error we did the scripts *calculateAnnotationsEventLog_baseline.py* and *calculateAnnotationsEventLog_pretsa.py* to calculate the average annotation for the privatizied event logs:
```
python calculateAnnotationsEventLog_baseline.py <dictName>
python calculateAnnotationsEventLog_pretsa.py <dictName>
```

With *generateAnnotationOriginalDataset.py* we generate the statistics of the original event logs:
```
python generateAnnotationOriginalDataset.py <dictName>
```

Finally we run *calculateAnnotationError.py* to calculate the relative error of the annotations for each activity:
```
python calculateAnnotationError.py <dictName>
```
# PRETSA*/BF-PRETSA
Furthermore this repository contains the implementation of improved versions of the PRETSA-algorithm currently under reviews as a journal extension. These algorithms are namely:
- PRETSA* -> An algorithm that guarantees optimal event log sanitazation through application of A*-search
- BF-PRETSA -> An algorithm using best-first search

## How to repeat our experiments

We will describe in this section how we conducted our experiments for our journal extension:
```
python startExperimentsForJournalExtension_<algorithmName>.py <filePath>
```
That the parallel execution of all anonymization settings for the algorithm specified in <algorithmName>. Please note, that this starts 25 processes at the same time. All of them potentially need intensive computional resources. Therefore, we recommend only executing these scripts on a powerful server.
 
The evaluation metrics can be derived by running the the following scripts:
```
python getResultsJournalExtension_<evaluation_metric>.py <dirPath> <dataset> 
```
